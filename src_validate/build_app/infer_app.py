#Sample application adapted from the SAMMed3D repository's branch for the the SegFM challenge. 



# RAS: We provided image patch, and prompts generated in an RAS coordinate system, so we will not require any re-orientation.




#The SAMMed3D implementation reads in all the prompts in the implementation... but they only perform actions on the 
# foreground. This is because the logic that they use downstream would break if attempting to use it
# on the background, e.g.:

# Their prompt simulation (within the prompt region) would not work. Because they didn't do an actual mapping of the point
# coordinate to the model domain, as they went through other morphological operations (like resampling etc) and so used a 
# box mask which they would propagate through to the model domain and then sample a point from that. But they had not provided this for the background clicks.
# 
# Also, when they try to re-insert the changed voxels, they use an assignment according to semantic code. This also wouldn't work. 
# This would fail if background, as it typically is, has code of 0.  
# NOTE: Adjustments on our end could have been made to account for this somehow, but given that the foreground and background clicks may not necessary fall
# within the same resampled region, it would be non-trivial to implement this without changing their logic too much.

#The logic of their code is also written in a way that more than one point could not be passed through at the same time.
#The mechanism that they used was heavily dependent on the simulation strategy of the segFM challenge which presumed that the prompts
# were always sampled according to the maximal error region.
# 
#   - When they read in the clicks, they first append all the foreground, and then all the background for a given semantic class.
#   - IN THAT ORDER. 
#   
#   Then, when they are assessing whether or not to actually perform inference, they look at the semantic code of the final appended
#   click, and if it is a foreground code, they perform inference. But clearly, this will effectively terminate all refinement once
#   a background click is appended, as the last click will always be a background click. 

#   - This is because they do not have a mechanism to determine whether the last click was a foreground or background click,


#This is not going to work for us, as we want to be able to pass both foreground and background clicks at the same time. 

#So we will just skip over the background clicks, and if there are no foreground clicks we just have to return the existing
# segmentation mask, as we cannot perform inference without any foreground clicks. 


#Lastly, their implementation was presuming that the inference script would be run each iteration rather than being like an app, 
# but they did not provide a mechanism for retaining the lowres mask in some storage, so we will not do that either! 
# We just follow their own logic for retaining the discrete pred mask and resample that into the model domain. Another 
# complication explaining their approach may be that of course the lowres mask is in the model domain, and if you only want 
# to execute inference on a subregion of the full image then it becomes non-trivial to keep the "lowres mask" consistent....
# unlike the 2D slice case where you just execute inference on the slice the prompt is placed on.
